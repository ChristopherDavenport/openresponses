#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds, vets and tests each nested module the way a consumer gets it:
# extracted from the tree into a directory with no parent go.mod, with
# the in-tree replace directives dropped, so every first-party require is
# answered by the module proxy and not by the directory next door.
#
#   scripts/check-extracted.sh providers/anthropic
#
# This is the only thing here that compiles a nested module against the
# version its own go.mod names. A replace is a property of the main
# module, so a consumer ignores it and gets the require — but while the
# module is only ever built inside this tree the replace answers first
# and that require line is never resolved.
#
# What it catches that check-replaces.sh and release-guard.sh do not:
# those check that a require is present and that it names the version
# being tagged. Both are claims about a version string. Neither compiles
# anything against it. Pin agenttool's mcpclient to agenttool v0.0.1 and
# both stay silent while this fails:
#
#   ./mcp.go:387:33: undefined: agenttool.WithResource
#   ./mcp.go:394:19: undefined: agenttool.NewFunc
#   ./mcp.go:409:44: undefined: agenttool.Annotations
#   ./mcp.go:519:24: undefined: agenttool.ProgressInfo
#
# That reproduction is the whole justification for this script; keep it
# here. openresponses' release-guard.sh did this once, at v0.0.11 —
# "build it the way a consumer does: outside the workspace, against the
# published root rather than the checkout next door", and it ran build,
# vet and test. It worked because the nested go.mod carried no replace
# then. The replace added at v0.0.12 turned that same line into a build
# against the tree, because GOWORK=off stopped meaning "no local root",
# and nothing said so: the line still runs and still prints ok. This
# restores what it used to prove, by dropping the replace in a copy
# rather than removing it from the tree, which the release needs.
#
# Needs the network; the requires resolve from the proxy. A required
# version the proxy cannot serve is reported as that, not as a build
# failure — see the note in release-guard.sh about where that happens.
